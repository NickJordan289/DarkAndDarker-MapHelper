# DarkAndDarker-MapHelper
Small python script that generates the path you travelled using OpenCV to read the minimap.

Goal is to use the markers shown on https://darkanddarker.map.spellsandguns.com/map/Crypt-01-N to help learn loot locations.

## How to use
```sh
python playback.py examples/example.mp4
```
### The script can be modified to run in realtime but currently only accepts video input.
### At the time of writing this also only supports 5120x1440 video


# Example output
